//   11. Write a program that calculates the energy needed to
// heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water.

//     >The formula to compute the energy is
//     >Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184

//     >where M is the weight of water in kilograms temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules. 
    
//     Here is a sample run:
    
//     ![sample run](./resources/q6.jpg)
